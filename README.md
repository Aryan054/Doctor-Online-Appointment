# Django Healthcare Management System

A robust and feature-rich web application built with Python and Django, designed to modernize and simplify the interactions within a healthcare ecosystem. This platform connects patients, doctors, and administrators, providing a seamless experience for appointment booking, medical record management, and administrative oversight.

## Core Features

This project is built around a powerful role-based system (Patient, Doctor, Admin) and includes the following key features:

-   **👨‍⚕️ Role-Based Dashboards:** Separate, tailored dashboards for Patients, Doctors, and Administrators, showing relevant information and actions at a glance.
-   **🗓️ Advanced Appointment Scheduling:** Patients can search for doctors by specialty, view their availability in real-time, and book appointments. The system handles availability checks and prevents double-booking.
-   **🩺 Medical Records Management:** Doctors can create, view, and manage detailed medical records for patients following a consultation, including diagnosis, treatment, and attached documents.
-   **⭐️ Reviews and Ratings:** After a completed appointment, patients can leave a rating and review for their doctor, helping build a trusted community.
-   **💳 Simulated Online Payments:** A complete, simulated payment workflow allows patients to pay for their appointments online, updating the appointment status accordingly.
-   **⚙️ Doctor Availability Control:** Doctors have a dedicated interface to manage their weekly work schedules, which dynamically updates the available slots for patient booking.
-   **🔔 Notification System:** An integrated system to notify users of important events, such as appointment confirmations, status changes, and new medical records.
-   **📊 Admin Reporting:** Administrators have access to a reporting tool to generate summaries of appointments, payments, and patient registrations for any given period.
-   **🔐 Secure Authentication:** A custom user model with secure login, registration, and password management for all roles.

## Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Python, Django
-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
-   **Database:** SQLite 3 (for development)
-   **Core Concepts:** MVC Architecture, RESTful principles (for API), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
